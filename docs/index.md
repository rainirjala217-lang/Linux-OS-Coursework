## 🧭 Project Overview

This project explores the configuration, security, and performance evaluation of a **headless Linux server** managed entirely via the **command-line interface (CLI)** over **SSH**.  
The work is structured into **seven weekly phases**, reflecting progressive learning and implementation of system administration, security hardening, and performance analysis.

Through this project, I will:

- Deploy and administer a **Linux Server** (Ubuntu Server or equivalent) without a graphical interface  
- Manage the system remotely from a **workstation client** using **SSH**  
- Implement **core and advanced security controls**, including firewall, privilege management, and intrusion prevention  
- Develop **performance monitoring and automation scripts** using Bash  
- Evaluate **system performance under multiple workloads**  
- Conduct a **comprehensive security audit** and performance optimisation analysis

## 🌐 System Architecture

The setup includes:
- **Server System:** Linux Server (headless, CLI-only)  
- **Workstation System:** Administrative client (via SSH)  
All interactions and configurations are executed remotely, enforcing command-line proficiency.

A detailed **System Architecture Diagram** and configuration documentation are provided in **Week 1**.

## 🔍 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, I aim to demonstrate:
1. **Technical Proficiency:** Confident administration of a Linux system via CLI and SSH  
2. **Security Awareness:** Implementation and validation of industry-standard hardening techniques  
3. **Performance Competence:** Ability to measure, interpret, and optimise OS and application performance  
4. **Professional Practice:** Clear documentation, reproducible configurations, and reflective analysis
